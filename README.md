## Usage

### Searching

Simple to search on whatever you want.

```
@ <keyword> <search_query>
```

keyword: is the short version of the web site's name.
search_query: search query, nothing special. Just I need to mention here it'll be encoded.

### Adding a search engine

Adding search engine to multi-searchbox is simple. Please just type:

```
@ +<keyword> <site_name> <url>
```

keyword: is the short-name of the web site
site_name: is the name of the web site
url: can be similar to this one: "https://example.com/search?q="

### Removing a search engine
